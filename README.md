# AJR-reversal

Here I have uploaded the complete package where I've critically replicated Acemoglu. Johnson and Robinson's main results from their critically acclaimed paper "Reversal of Fortune". I use data from two different sources for alternate proxies of pre-modern development and find some weakness in the 2SLS results along with a few other results that don't hold for certain sub-samples.
